## Status Update (2025-05-15)

This library is unmaintained and is incompatible with recent nushell versions.

Nuitron largely worked around the various deficiencies of nushell at the time. Today nushell is much improved, and I estimate if nuitron was ported today to e.g. nushell version v0.104 (latest version at the time of writing), up to %70 of the codebase can be thrown away.

# Nuitron, an utility library for Nushell

This is a functional- and pipe-oriented module for Nushell, containing various utility functions.

It's suitable for day-to-day use in the REPL as well as in the scripts.

For documentation, import the module in your shell with `use` and check out `--help` texts.
